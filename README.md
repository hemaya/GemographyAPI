# GemographyAPI
Using .NET CORE c# - MediatR, Cqrs, and clean archetecture. I wrote an api to retrieve last 30 days repos from githup, grouped by languages (Java,Java script,..)
There are some repos with no language 'null', so you can find them under category of Non specified language' 
The function of this api is simple but i built it in this way with different layers so it will be easy to be extendable with no issues in maintability and keep the SOLID principles

you can find the challenge in this url:
